**_Help frontline clinicians triage patients in ICUs by rapidly assessing a patient's overall health for informed clinical decisions that will improve patient outcomes and relieve COVID19 ICU overload._**

We used the [WIDS 2021 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2021/data), which focuses on patient health, with an emphasis on the chronic condition of diabetes. An ICU patient's chronic conditions, such as heart disease, injuries, or diabetes, may not be readily available due to the patient's condition or if the patient is from another medical provider or system. Knowing a patient's chronic diseases can expedite clinical decisions about their care and ultimately improve their health outcomes.  The speed-up of patient outcomes relieves Intensive Care Units (ICUs) struggling with overload from critical COVID-19 pandemic cases.  Our AI solution, **ICU-OPS**, _is rapidly channeling medical emergencies in the right hands, leading to the best possible patient outcomes._
